NetMet is networking tool that allows you to track and analyze network uptime of multi data centers installations

## Motivation

As a cloud provider one must gurantee SLA. For example 99.95% dataplane uptime
(~43 seconds downtime per day).
This means few things:
- Cloud provider cannot rely on customer generated tickets for downtime measurements.
- Cloud provider needs to be proactive:
  - Get alerts within seconds after any downtime occurs.
  - Have all required data for debugging in place
    - What Data Centers (DC), Availability Zones (AZ) & Servers are effected
    - Is it an underlay or overlay network issue
    - When the event started and when it stopped


To verify uptime requirements we developed NetMet â€“ a tool that constantly
measures connectivity between all servers including those in different
availability zones or even different data centers.

We use standard GitHub process with Issues & PR.

## Architecture

![Netmet Architecture](media/netmet-architecture.png)

The client-server architecture of NetMet was designed with a clear separation
of concerns in mind:

- Clients periodically perform connectivity checks between each other
- Clients periodically perform Internet connectivty checks
- Clients send data to server
- Server performs aggregation of data and stores it in ElasticSearch
- Server exposes an API for retrieving aggregated data to facilitate visualization of it.

## Deployment

Run all netmet clients and servers:

- Netmet Server: run few instances of netmet servers under HAproxy or Nginx
- Netmet Client: run 1 client per 1 server that should be monitored


### Physical placement

To collect all metrics needed to monitor network of Data Centers use next schema:

![Netmet Deployment](media/netmet-deployment.png)

- Run few instances of Netmet servers in different regions
- Run 1 instance of Netmet client per 1 server
- Elasticsearch cluster mode

### Logical placement

To avoid Netmet downtime use next schema:

![Netmet Placement](media/netmet-deployment-logical.png)

- Netmet servers should be run under Nginx/HAproxy/Lbaas (for now)
- Netmet server may use multiple Elasticsearch addresses (no need in HA)

### Install & Run

To install NetMet from source you should run next command

    pip install .   # run it from root directory

After that ``netmet`` command should become available

To run Netmet Server

    APP=server NETMET_SERVER_URL="<url:port>" NETMET_OWN_URL="<url:port>" ELASTIC="<url:port>" PORT=5005 netmet

To run Netmet Client

    APP=client PORT=5005 netmet

### Configure & Upgrade

Netmet is meant to be very easy to configuration. All configuration is done
via Netmet server API method POST /api/v1/config which in future is going to
update installation (remove/add clients), geneate new client configurations
and update clients


![Updates & Upgrades](media/netmet-deployment-update.png)

To configure the Netmet use POST /api/v2/config

    cat > config.json <<- EOM
    {
        "deployment": {
            "static": {
                "clients": [
                    {
                        "az": "test-az",
                        "dc": "test-dc",
                        "host": "127.0.0.1",
                        "ip": "127.0.0.1",
                        "port": 5001
                    }
                ]
          }
        },
        "external": [
            {"dest": "8.8.8.8", "period": 1, "protocol": "icmp", "timeout": 0.5}
        ],
        "mesher": {
            "full_mesh": {}
        }
    }
    EOM

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '@config.json' ${NETMET_SERVER_URL}/api/v2/config

## Running Tests

Running test is very easy.

Install tox tool

    pip install tox

Run tox

    tox             # runs all tests
    tox -e pep8     # runs only pep8 code style checks
    tox -e py27     # runs unit tests using python 2.7
